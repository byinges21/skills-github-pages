Homework 3
Material covered:       7. Intro to Tidyverse and Tidying Data

                                     8. Data Manipulation

Follow the directions below to complete the assignment. Once you have completed the assignment, submit your answer on Canvas before the due date.

Submission Guidelines:

Due date:                        April 30, 2025 at 8:45 am

Submission means:         You will submit an .R script containing all code, comments and explanations (remember to use # at the beginning of your comment) for each question in order to receive credit for your work.

Submission details:         Students must make sure that their answers are readable, complete, and submitted before the deadline. Late submission for ANY reason, whether in part or in whole, or unreadable files will trigger the late penalties. The time when I receive the last part of your answers will count when computing late penalties, not the time when you sent the answers.

Late Penalties:                 If an assignment is turned immediately after the due date, your score will be reduced by 10% of the maximum assignment grade. Additional 10% will be deducted from your score for every 24 hours after that.

Academic Integrity:        This is an individual assignment. Students need to submit their own answers and understand those answers. I reserve the right to ask you to walk me through the code for your assignment. If you fail to explain the code in detail and the choices you made, you will receive 0 points for the part of the assignment. Students who refuse to provide the explanation for their work will receive 0 points for the entire assignment.
